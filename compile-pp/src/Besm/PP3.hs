  The third part of the programming programme contains approxiamtely 450 instructions and 30 constants and consists of four blocks, functioning in succession one after the other: the block for forming relative addresses (I-PP-3), the block for distributing the store (OO-PP-3), the block for assigning true addresses (III-PP-3) and the block for printing information (IV-PP-3). The functioning of PP-3 is organized by a small master programme (MP-3), containing also the standard sub-routine for printing instructions in reference to them by the instruction found in cell 0001. This sub-routine is taken from the library of standard programmes and therefore its description will not be presented heere.

  During the functioning of PP-3 the store contains MP-3 and one of four blocks of PP-3, called up when necessary, since the PP can engage not more than 256 celles of IS. Information on the problem in standard position is stored in IS completely. At the termination of functioning of PP-3 the finished programme is found on MD-1.

  PP-3 realizes the third stage of functionmin of the programming algorithm (S 19) and functions in the following manner (Fig 15).


  Op. 1 of MP-3 reads the programme block I-PP-3 from MD-4 and transfers control to it. The block I-PP-3 changes the codes of the operator numbers in the instructions to the relative addresses of the first instructions of these operators, eliminates the open-parentheses of loops from the programme and signs of operator numbers and chagnes the relative address of the instructions in correspondence with theese.

  Op. 2 reads from MD-4 the programme of block II-PP-3 and transfers control to it. The block II-PP-3 carries out distribution of the store,determining the final location of the storage blocks employed in the solution of the programme and calculates the corrections which must be added to the codes of quantities to obtain their true addresses.

  Op. 3 reads from MD-4 the programme of block III-PP-3 and transfers control to it. The block III-PP-3 carries out assignment of true addresses.

  Op. 4 reads from MD-4 the programme of block IV-PP-3 and transfers control to it. The block IV-PP-3 prints information on the storage distribution, prints programme components and constants relating to them, composes the programme and the constants in accordance with the distribution of the store and writes them on MD-1, completing by this the functioning of the PP.

  In the description of the functioning of PP-3 it is necessary to consider the two positions of blocks in the store: standard and "final", ie that which they are to have in correspondence with which position is under consiteration the characteristics of the block locations in their final positions will be denoted by an asterisk. Thus for example ùúé*f denotes the last cell of block ùúé in its final position in the store in distinction to ùúéf, denoting hte same characteristic in the standard position of block ùúé.

  Block for the formation of relative addresses

  The block I-PP-3 consists of the basic programme (operatores 1 -33) and four sub-routies: the sub-routines for forming relative addresses (operators 34-38) , the sub-routine for changing relative addresses  (operators 39- 45), the sub-routine for selecting instructions from block K (op. 46) and the sub-routine for transferring instructions to block K (op. 47).

  The first part of the basic programme (operators 1-13) carries out the substitution in the instructions of the operator numbers by the relative addresses of the first instructions of the operators with teh =given numbers. Operators 1-13 organize the sequence of selection of programme instruction addresses and return of instructions wit hchagned addresses to the programme. The direct testinf of addresses and the substitution of operator numbers by relative addresses is realized by teh sub-routine for forming relative addresses.

  Op. 1 sends K0 to counter K, in which is fixed the address of the last instruction selectedfrom block K.

  Op. 2 selects the next instruction in block K and adds unity to counter K.

  Op. 3 determines the case where open-parentheses of the loop or the sign of an operator number have been selected, transferring control to op. 12.

  Storage Distribution Block

  In accordance with the diagram on page 70 the final distribution of the store appears as follows: parameter counters (block ), constants and variable quantities (block C), programme (block K), constants for the programme (block \…£), block O, M and, finally the working cells (block R). For each of these seven bloccks M^i the storage distribution block (II-PP-3) forms the following quantities: M_O^i*, the address of the cell diractly before the block, Mbar^i, the extent of the block and M_f*^i, the address of the last cell of the block (we note that M_f*^i = M_o^(i + 1). Then the corrections to the codes of quantities are calculated: Œî C, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of constants and variable quantiteis from the block C and the parameter counters, Œî K, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of programme instructions Œî…£, the correction for obtaining the true addreses of constants from block …£and Œî R, the correction for obaining the true addresses of working cells.

  In addition, the block II-PP-3 carries out transformation of information on variable addressses in the block V and prints inforamtion on the variable addresses in the block V and the positions of the blocks M^i in the store. The third address of the first cell of M^i is placed in each "main head" with information on storage blocks M^i (i = 1..l); the "main head" itself with the eliminated operation code are printed in the form of an instruction. In each line of iunformation about a variable address relating to the storage block M^i (i = 1..l), the magnitude of the block M^i is set in the first address while in the second address , the address of its start M*_l^i.
  These data will be utilized in forming the initial values of variable addrsesses during the period of functioning of block III-PP-3.
  the scheme of block II-PP-3 is represented in Fig. 17.

  Op 1. calculates Pbar, Cbar, Kbar, …£bar Obar and C_0*, K_0*, …£_0*, O_0*, M_0*

  Op. 4 tetsts the selected line, transferring control to op. 5 if a "main head" has been selected for the next block M^i (i = 1.. l).

  Op. 5 extracts the third address of the "main head".

  Op. 6 compares the extracted address with zero. If it is not equal to zero this deneotes that the corresponding block M^i relates to the group of constants from block C. In this case op. 10 functions.

  Op. 7 sets M_l^i* in tyhe third address of the "main head" and calculates M_l^(i+1)* = M_l^i* +Mbar^i.

  Op. 8 compares M_l^(i+1)* with 03FFF.

  Op. 9 is a check stop for M_l^(i+1)* 03FFF.

  If M^i relates to the group of constants from block C,

  Op. 10 obtains the true address M_l^i*, adding Œî C to the third address of the "main head".

  Op. 11 eliminates the operation code in the "main head".

  Op. 12 prints information on the current block M^i.

  Op. 13 sets Mbar^i in the first address and M_l^i* in the second address of a certain working cell for arranging these quantities in the line of information on the variable addresses relating to the block M^i.

  If a line of information on a variable address has been selected,

  Op. 14 sets Mbar^i in the first address of this line and in the second address M_l^i*, leaving the magnitude of the shift delta of the variable address in the third address, and the sign of the shift in the eleventh place of the first address.

  Op. 15  transfers the processed line of information back to block V.

  Op. 16 carries out modification of the selection instruction address and the arrangements in op. 3 and op. 15.

  Block for Assigning True Addresses

  The block III-PP-3 substitues their true addresses for the codes of quantities and the relative address of variable instructions in the instructions of the assembled programme. Detemrinination of the types of quantities according to the values of their codes is cvarried out in accordance with Table 17 (S 19).

  The first part of the block (operators 1 -18) carries out assignment of true addresses. The direct substitution of codes of quantities or relative addresses by true address of quantities or instructions is carried out by a sub-routeine (operators 26 -42).

  Op. 1 sets K_0 in coutner K, in which will be stored the addres of the current instruction selected from the programme during funcitioning of the block.

  In the description of BESM it was indicated that usually in the instruction "CCCC wit hsecond address", in reference t o a sub-routine, the addresss of the second instruction of RTC is given in the second address. In coding the instruction "CCCC with second addresss" the addresss in RTC is an operator number assigned to the instructions of RTC. In assigning true addresses this operator number will be substituted by the true addrses of the first instruction of RTC since to obtain the correct second address of CCCC it is necessary to increas it by 1'

  Op. 14, in accordance with the above, transers control to op. 15 if an instruction CCCC has been selected in the cell.

  op. 15 determines the case of instruction CCCC in the second address of which is a relative address, transferring control to op. 16.

  Zeros in the corresponding places denote the contrary.

  After printing the programme and constants (if they were required to be printed), two vcheck sums are printed (the contents of the programme with all constants relating to it are summed before and after writing on MD-1). Agreement of the check sums ensures correct recording of the constructed programme on MD-1.
