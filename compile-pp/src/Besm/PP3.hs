  The third part of the programming programme contains approximately 450
  instructions and 30 constants and consists of four blocks, functioning in
  succession one after the other: the block for forming relative addresses
  (I-PP-3), the block for distributing the store (OO-PP-3), the block for
  assigning true addresses (III-PP-3) and the block for printing information
  (IV-PP-3). The functioning of PP-3 is organized by a small master programme
  (MP-3), containing also the standard sub-routine for printing instructions in
  reference to them by the instruction found in cell 0001. This sub-routine is
  taken from the library of standard programmes and therefore its description
  will not be presented here.

  During the functioning of PP-3 the store contains MP-3 and one of four
  blocks of PP-3, called up when necessary, since the PP can engage not more
  than 256 cells of IS. Information on the problem in standard position is
  stored in IS completely. At the termination of functioning of PP-3 the
  finished programme is found on MD-1.

  PP-3 realizes the third stage of function of the programming algorithm(S 19)
  and functions in the following manner (Fig 15).

    Op. 1 of MP-3 reads the programme block I-PP-3 from MD-4 and transfers
    control to it. The block I-PP-3 changes the codes of the operator numbers
    in the instructions to the relative addresses of the first instructions of
    these operators, eliminates the open-parentheses of loops from the
    programme and signs of operator numbers and changes the relative address of
    the instructions in correspondence with these.

  Op. 4 reads from MD-4 the programme of block IV-PP-3 and transfers

  distribution of the store and writes them on MD-1, completing by this the
  functioning of the PP.

{-
  In the description of the functioning of PP-3 it is necessary to consider the two positions of blocks in the store: standard and "final", ie that which they are to have in correspondence with which position is under consiteration the characteristics of the block locations in their final positions will be denoted by an asterisk. Thus for example ùúé*f denotes the last cell of block ùúé in its final position in the store in distinction to ùúéf, denoting hte same characteristic in the standard position of block ùúé.

  Block for the formation of relative addresses

  The block I-PP-3 consists of the basic programme (operators 1-33) and four sub-routines:
    the sub-routines for forming relative addresses (operators 34-38),
    the sub-routine for changing relative addresses (operators 39- 45),
    the sub-routine for selecting instructions from block K (op. 46)
    and the sub-routine for transferring instructions to block K (op. 47).

  The first part of the basic programme (operators 1-13) carries out the
  substitution in the instructions of the operator numbers by the relative
  addresses of the first instructions of the operators with the given
  numbers. Operators 1-13 organize the sequence of selection of programme
  instruction addresses and return of instructions wit changed addresses to
  the programme. The direct testing of addresses and the substitution of
  operator numbers by relative addresses is realized by the sub-routine for
  forming relative addresses.

  Storage Distribution Block

  In accordance with the diagram on page 70 the final distribution of the store appears as follows: parameter counters (block ), constants and variable quantities (block C), programme (block K), constants for the programme (block \…£), block O, M and, finally the working cells (block R). For each of these seven blocks M^i the storage distribution block (II-PP-3) forms the following quantities: M_O^i*, the address of the cell directly before the block, Mbar^i, the extent of the block and M_f*^i, the address of the last cell of the block (we note that M_f*^i = M_o^(i + 1). Then the corrections to the codes of quantities are calculated: Œî C, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of constants and variable quantities from the block C and the parameter counters, Œî K, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of programme instructions Œî…£, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of constants from block …£ and Œî R, the correction for obtaining the true addresses of working cells.

  In addition, the block II-PP-3 carries out transformation of information on variable addresses in the block V and prints information on the variable addresses in the block V and the positions of the blocks M^i in the store. The third address of the first cell of M^i is placed in each "main head" with information on storage blocks M^i (i = 1..l); the "main head" itself with the eliminated operation code are printed in the form of an instruction. In each line of information about a variable address relating to the storage block M^i (i = 1..l), the magnitude of the block M^i is set in the first address while in the second address , the address of its start M*_l^i.
  These data will be utilized in forming the initial values of variable addresses during the period of functioning of block III-PP-3.
  the scheme of block II-PP-3 is represented in Fig. 17.

  Block for Assigning True Addresses

  The block III-PP-3 substitutes their true addresses for the codes of quantities and the relative address of variable instructions in the instructions of the assembled programme. Determination of the types of quantities according to the values of their codes is cvarried out in accordance with Table 17 (S 19).

  The first part of the block (operators 1 -18) carries out assignment of true addresses. The direct substitution of codes of quantities or relative addresses by true address of quantities or instructions is carried out by a sub-routeine (operators 26 -42).

  This one is quite different from the machine code. unclear why.

  The block IV-PP-3 prints the information on the storage distribution, prints if necessary, the assembled programme and constants, transforms the constants, if necessary t the binary systema nd writes the assembled programme and cvonstants on MD-1.

  Information on storage distribution gives data on the distribution in IS of all seven blocks (S 33): block P, block C, block K, block gamma, block O, block M and block R. The printed inforamtion on each of these blocks M (i 1..7) has the form of an instructon with zero operation code, in the addresses of which are the following quantities:

    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ M_1^i* ‚îÇ Mbar^i ‚îÇ M_f^i* ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

  ie the address of the first cell of the block, the extetd of the block and the address of the last cell of the block. In addition, a conditional number is printed for each block, an index according to which information on the given block is conveniently located on the printed tape.
  For the i-th block thsi number is printed in the form

      + iiiiiiii,i+

  Information on the storage distribution processed by block II-PP-3 , is distributed in the storage cells in successsion (one number in each cell), in the following order: Pbar, Cbar, Kbar, gamma bar, obar, Mbar, Rbar.

  Pbar_0*=0, C_0*,K_0*,gmma_0*,O_0*,M_0*,R_0*,R_f* permitting the unambiguous formation of lines of infroamtion on all blocks.

  The indices determining if it is necessary to print the programme and constants, and if it is necessary to transform constants to the binary system are given by the contents of cell DS 1100, led out to the control console of BESM.
  Unity in the third place deontoes that the programme need not be printed, unity in the second place denotes that the constants need not be printed , unity in the first place denotes that the constants need not be transformed to the binary system.
  Zeros in the corresponding places denote the contrary.

  After printing the programme and constants (if they were required to be printed), two check sums are printed (the contents of the programme with all constants relating to it are summed before and after writing on MD-1). Agreement of the check sums ensures correct recording of the constructed programme on MD-1.
