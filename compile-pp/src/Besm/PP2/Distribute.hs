At the start of functioning of block III-PP-2 there are located in blocks
alpha and beta all control instructions not including loop comparisons and
instructions for changing parameters located in standard cells. The block
III-PP-2 distributes the constructed control instructions, changing the
addresses of variable instructions to their relative addresses. Since transfer
of control instructions from block beta is carries out twice -- the first time
the restoration instructions located "beyond the loop" are transferred, the
second time the address-modification instructions located at the end of the
repetitive part of the loop, the transfer instructions from block beta are
placed in a separate sub-routine (operators 29-38). At the fierst reference to
the sub-routine there takes place transfer from block beta only of the
restoration instructions and in the second only the address-modification
instructions.

In addition, there are two further sub-routines in the block: the sub-routine
for transfer from the programme (op. 39 and op. 40), which transfers.
instructions from the block K, beginning with the last instruction, to the
standard cell and the sub-routine for transfer to the programme (op. 41),
which realizes all transfers of control instructions and "shifted" programme
instructions to block K, also beginning with the last instruction.
